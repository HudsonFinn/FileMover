# FileMover
This is a little project I worked on over a couple of weekends to make sorting my downloads folder easier!

At the moment you run it and it will sit in the background and monitor your downloads folder (Or any folder that you like) and when a file is added it will sort that file and any other file into folders such as Audio, Video, Pictures, Text, Data, Ect. At the moment it supports over 50 file types. On top of that there is built in functionality to unzip all downloaded zip files into a serperate uncompressed folder.

In the near future I will be adding Functionality to sort and manually and update the interface to make it more appealing! Other features may be a way to let users edit the sorting mechanism although I believe it would require alot of work so I'll see how busy I am.
