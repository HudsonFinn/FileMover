# File Moving Project
This is a little project I worked on over a couple of weekends to make sorting my downloads/all folders easier!

This is my first full python programme and I have tried to keep the code managable and reasonably readable. All code is run from the __main__.py file and I have attempted to modualise all the parts of the programme into classes. I have also built some custom exceptions which can be found in the settingsExceptions.py file.

Please feel free to use the programme edit the programme and use it in any way you you want to. Also if you would like to extend the functionality feel free to make a pull request and I'll grant anything that seems generally useful to anyone
